# Virtual Box

In this section you will learn how to get information about virtual box VMs:

For function reference and examples we assume, that we imported systeminspector as follows:

```
const si = require('systeminspector');
```

## VMs

All functions in this section return a promise or can be called with a callback function (parameter cb in the function reference)
