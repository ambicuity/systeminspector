# Docker

In this section you will learn how to get information about docker, images, containers, container stats and processes inside a docker container:

For function reference and examples we assume, that we imported systeminspector as follows:

```
const si = require('systeminspector');
```

## Container, Stats, Processes

All functions in this section return a promise or can be called with a callback function (parameter cb in the function reference)
